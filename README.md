# BayonetTickets

Bayonet Tickets is a small, open sourced IT support ticketing application which has been integrated to be centralized around a [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat) server. 

Users submit tickets through the application, and after setting up bot account for your RC server, it posts to a ticketing group defined.

The [Bayonet Ticket Manager](https://github.com/starhound/Bayonet_Ticket_Manager) then allows members of your IT team to view tickets and mark them as "In Progress" or "Complete", along with the input of notes regarding the solution or work performed.

You will need to supply a Rocket.Chat [bot account information](https://github.com/starhound/BayonetTickets/blob/master/Ticketing_Stub/API.cs#L12), the room ID of your tickets group, along with a [Imgur Client ID and Client Secret](https://github.com/starhound/BayonetTickets/blob/master/Ticketing_Stub/Form1.cs#L37). 

You can find more information about the Imgur API and how to register your application from [here](https://api.imgur.com/).

Brief overview of features:
  * Imgur API Integration 
  * Rocket.Chat Integration 
  * Quick Selection List - For common place issues (editable via a xml file - [Issues.xml](https://github.com/starhound/BayonetTickets/blob/master/Ticketing_Stub/Issues.xml))
  * Search function to let users see all open/active tickets they have.
  
The tickets and data generated by this client can be manipulated and altered from the [Bayonet Ticket Manager](https://github.com/starhound/Bayonet_Ticket_Manager).

For deployment you have a couple options:
 1. Deploy the application unpacked to a shared directory on your network, use a GPO to create shortcuts to the produced exe file for all users.
 2. Create an installer, use a GPO to force all clients to install the client.
